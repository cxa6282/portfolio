          <p class="project-text">Web Checkers was developed as my Intro to Software Engineering term-long project. The project aimed to teach the basics of Agile and OpenUP development approaches, as we worked in a team of 5.</p>
          <p class="project-text">The assigned materials were a vision document outlining the product owner's requirements, and a simple code base for a Spark webpage.

          <p class="project-text">While consise, we found the vision document left a lot of room for interpretation of the design. We decided to use state-based behavior to prevent any headaches later on in the event of a misinterpretation with the vision document.</p>

          <p class="project-text">The game was completed and tested with a full suite of JUnit tests, as well as analyzed using JaCoCo for code complexity metrics.</p>
          <p class="project-text">Overall it was a fun project that introduced a lot of standard procedures in software development ranging from planning to presenting.</p>
